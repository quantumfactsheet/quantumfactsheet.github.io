<h1><a name='header-n0' class='md-header-anchor '></a>The Quantum Computing Fact Sheet</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Research in quantum computing is coming out of the labs.  Because of its commercial and national security significance the advent of functioning quantum computers is subject to intense news coverage.</p><p>As quantum computing becomes part of the public discourse and its concepts are communicated to wider audiences by news outlets, think tanks and policymakers, it is important to maintain a minimal level of factual correctness in describing its functioning and potential. Inflating the current state of progress or giving erroneous characterisations of the basic principles of functioning of a quantum computer hinders both the scientific and commercial progress of quantum computation.</p><p>Key concepts in quantum computing have subtle definitions that are difficult to convey using simple metaphors or without employing lengthy explanations. It is partially the duty of the quantum computing research community to come up with better ways to popularise the field. </p><p>In the meanwhile, the purpose of this fact sheet is to provide a list of facts that one cannot get wrong when talking or writing about quantum computers. Compliance with the information contained in this list would help one to ensure a minimal level of factual correctness.</p><p>We believe it is important that the authors of this fact sheet remain accountable. You can find more information about the authors of this webpage <a href="https://andrearocchetto.github.io/">here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name='header-n19' class='md-header-anchor '></a>General facts</h3><ul><li>A quantum computer cannot be thought as equivalent to multiple classical computers that share information and execute calculations in parallel.</li><li>Presently, quantum computers capable to function according to our theoretical models do not exist. Current machines are affected by significant levels of error which we are unable to control. </li><li>Quantum computers are not faster than classical computers for every type of computational task but only provide advantage for certain classes of problems. Two prototypical examples are factoring numbers into primes and searching through unstructured databases. </li><li>Although the problem of simulating another quantum system (which is relevant for material and drug discovery) is expected to be a problem where quantum computers provide an advantage, we cannot mathematically prove this is the case.</li><li>Although quantum computers can brake a commonly used type of encryption, not every form of encryption can be attacked by a quantum computer.</li></ul><h3><a name='header-n45' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Closer to the news</h3><h4><a name='header-n54' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Machine learning and optimisation</h4><ul><li>Using quantum computers to accelerate optimisation and machine learning tasks is an active research area but, as of today, we have not identified realistic settings where quantum computers can provide advantages .</li></ul><h4><a name='header-n55' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Quantum supremacy</h4><ul><li>A proof of quantum supremacy refers to a computational task that can only be performed in a reasonable time by a quantum computer (when a quantum computer takes 1 second and a classical computer takes 100 years we are confidently in the realm of quantum supremacy). </li><li>Tasks that have been proposed for quantum supremacy experiments are highly specific and without known practical application.  </li><li>If a quantum device is capable of giving a proof of quantum supremacy it does not immediately follow that the same device can be used to solve efficiently problems other than the one that was specifically designed to solve. </li></ul>
